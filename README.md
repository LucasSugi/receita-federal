# Receita Federal
This repository is intended to download public data that are made available by the Federal Revenue on the website https://dados.gov.br/dados/conjuntos-dados/cadastro-nacional-da-pessoa-juridica-cnpj

These files are downloaded in `stream mode`, which allows you to restart the download from where it left off even in cases of connection problems.

# How To Use
The `main.py` script demonstrates how to use this repository. Warning: Two folders will be needed, one where the zipped files will be stored and the other where these zips will be extracted. Such folders must be created before executing the scripts.
